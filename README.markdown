## NAME

*<font size="+1">Pinda</font>* -- <font size="+1"><b>P</b></font>ipeline for <font size="+1"><b>In</b></font>traspecies <font size="+1"><b>D</b></font>uplication <font size="+1"><b>A</b></font>nalysis 
## DESCRIPTION

A Web service aiming to facilitate detection of specific gene duplications in an organism species of choice. 

## AVAILABILITY

*Pinda* is located at <font size="-1"><a href="http://orion.mbg.duth.gr/Pinda/cgi/Pinda.cgi">http://orion.mbg.duth.gr/Pinda/cgi/Pinda.cgi</a></font>, whereas the Source Code can be obtained at <font size="-1"><a href="https://github.com/dgkontopoulos/Pinda">https://github.com/dgkontopoulos/Pinda</a></font>. 
## USAGE

At *Pinda*'s index page, you may enter a sequence, select a database for the analysis and submit your email address, so that you can be notified when the job is complete. After clicking the "Submit" button, *Pinda* will take you to the next page, where you may choose the organism within which the duplication analysis will take place. Past this point, your task has entered the queue. You will be notified after completion via email, including a possible duplications table, a multiple sequence alignment and a dendrogram.
