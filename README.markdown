## NAME

*<font size="+1">Pinda</font>* -- <font size="+1"><b>P</b></font>ipeline for <font size="+1"><b>In</b></font>traspecies <font size="+1"><b>D</b></font>uplication <font size="+1"><b>A</b></font>nalysis 
## DESCRIPTION

A Web service aiming to facilitate detection of specific gene duplications in an organism species of choice. 

## AVAILABILITY

*Pinda* is located at <a href="http://orion.mbg.duth.gr/Pinda" style="text-decoration:none">http://orion.mbg.duth.gr/Pinda</a>, whereas the Source Code can be obtained at <a href="https://github.com/dgkontopoulos/Pinda" style="text-decoration:none">https://github.com/dgkontopoulos/Pinda</a>. 

## USAGE

At *Pinda*'s starting page, you may enter a Protein or DNA sequence. After clicking the "Continue" button, *Pinda* will take you to the next page, where you may choose the organism and the database within which the duplication analysis will take place. You also have to enter your email address, so that you can be notified after the job is complete. Past this point, your task has entered the queue. You will receive its results via email, including a possible duplications table, a multiple sequence alignment and a dendrogram.
